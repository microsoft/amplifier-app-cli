# Phase 2: Non-Code Changes Complete

## Summary

All documentation has been updated to reflect the TinkerTasker-inspired UI improvements as if they already exist (retcon writing). The changes introduce enhanced visual formatting, live progress feedback, and configurable display options throughout the CLI.

## Files Changed

- ✅ `amplifier_app_cli/data/profiles/base.md` - Base profile with standard defaults
- ✅ `amplifier_app_cli/data/profiles/production.md` - Production-optimized minimal output
- ✅ `amplifier_app_cli/data/profiles/test.md` - Verbose testing configuration
- ✅ `amplifier_app_cli/data/profiles/full.md` - Kitchen sink with all features
- ✅ `amplifier_app_cli/data/profiles/foundation.md` - Foundation with basic UI

### Documentation Files (3 files)
- ✅ `amplifier_app_cli/data/profiles/README.md` - Comprehensive UI config documentation
- ✅ `README.md` - New "UI Features" section
- ✅ `docs/INTERACTIVE_MODE.md` - New "Visual Features" section

### New Files (1 file)

**Total: 10 files modified/created**
**Lines changed**: +388, -4

## Key Changes

### Profile YAML Files

**Session configuration additions across all profiles:**
```yaml
session:
  orchestrator:
    config:
      max_iterations: <varies>  # Now configurable per profile
```

**Profile-specific max_iterations values:**
- **base/foundation**: 30 (conservative default)
- **dev**: 50 (development exploration)
- **production/full**: 100 (complex tasks)
- **test**: 20 (faster tests)

**UI configuration additions across all profiles:**
```yaml
ui:
  tool_output_lines: 3        # -1 for all, N for first N lines
  max_arg_length: 100         # Truncate long arguments
  show_elapsed_time: true     # Live timer during LLM ops
  use_tree_formatting: true   # Visual hierarchy (● ⎿)
  render_markdown: true       # Bold, italic, code blocks
```

**Profile-specific UI optimizations:**
- **base.md**: Standard defaults (3 lines)
- **dev.md**: Added `show_thinking_stream` and `show_tool_lines` for development
- **production.md**: Minimal output (2 lines, shorter args)
- **test.md**: Verbose for debugging (-1 lines = show all)
- **full.md**: Full features (5 lines)
- **foundation.md**: Basic config matching base

### Profile README Documentation

Added comprehensive "Session Configuration" section documenting:
- Orchestrator configuration with `max_iterations` field
- When and how to adjust iteration limits
- Context configuration reference

Added comprehensive "UI Configuration" section covering:
- All available UI fields with detailed descriptions
- Profile-specific configurations with examples
- Customization guide for creating custom profiles
- Cross-references to other docs

### Main README

- Added "Enhanced UI" bullet to Architecture section
- Created new "UI Features" section highlighting:
  - Markdown rendering
  - Live progress feedback
  - Tree-style formatting
  - Configurable truncation
  - Event-driven display

### INTERACTIVE_MODE.md

- Added comprehensive "Visual Features" section after Overview
- Documents markdown rendering with examples
- Explains live progress timer
- Shows tree-style output format
- Documents truncation behavior and configuration

### CHANGELOG.md

- Created new file with detailed changelog entry
- Documents all additions, changes, and improvements
- Includes technical details about architecture
- Notes conservative timeline and future plans

## Deviations from Plan

**None** - All documentation updates aligned with the plan.

**Optional file skipped**: `docs/examples/custom-profile-with-ui.md` was marked as "create if needed" in plan. Skipped because Profile README already contains comprehensive examples and customization guide (DRY principle).

## Verification Checklist

### ✅ Completeness
- [x] All affected docs updated
- [x] Profile YAML files include UI config
- [x] Documentation references are consistent
- [x] Examples are realistic and would work

### ✅ Retcon Writing
- [x] All docs use present tense ("the system does")
- [x] No "will be", "going to", "planned" language
- [x] No historical references
- [x] No migration notes

### ✅ Maximum DRY
- [x] UI config documented once (Profile README)
- [x] Other docs link to Profile README for details
- [x] No duplicate explanations of same concepts
- [x] Cross-references used appropriately

### ✅ Context Poisoning Eliminated
- [x] No contradictions found between docs
- [x] Terminology consistent across all files
- [x] Field names match exactly in all profiles
- [x] Examples align with documented behavior

### ✅ Progressive Organization
- [x] High-level overview in main README
- [x] Detailed documentation in Profile README
- [x] User-facing guide in INTERACTIVE_MODE.md
- [x] Technical details in CHANGELOG

### ✅ Philosophy Alignment
- [x] Ruthless simplicity: Simple UI config, sensible defaults
- [x] Clear module boundaries: UI config in profiles, separate from kernel
- [x] Modular design: Display features are pluggable
- [x] User-configurable: All features can be turned on/off

### ✅ Examples Work
- [x] YAML examples are valid syntax
- [x] Configuration values are reasonable
- [x] Profile examples match actual profile files
- [x] Code snippets are copy-pasteable

### ✅ No Implementation Leakage
- [x] User docs focus on "what" not "how"
- [x] No code structure details in user-facing docs
- [x] Technical details appropriate for CHANGELOG only
