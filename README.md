# Amplifier CLI

Command-line interface for the Amplifier AI-powered modular development platform.

> **Note**: This is a **reference implementation** of an Amplifier CLI. It works with [amplifier-core](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-core) and demonstrates how to build a CLI around the official kernel. You can use this as-is, fork it, or build your own CLI using the core.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+**
- **[UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)** - Fast Python package manager

### Installing UV

```bash
# macOS/Linux/WSL
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

## Installation

```bash
# Install from PyPI (when published)
uv pip install amplifier-app-cli

# Install from source
uv pip install -e .

# Or use with uvx directly from GitHub
uvx --from git+https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-app-cli amplifier --help
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize a configuration
amplifier init

# Run a single command
amplifier run "Create a Python function to calculate fibonacci numbers"

# Start interactive chat mode
amplifier run --mode chat

# Use a specific provider
amplifier run --provider anthropic --model claude-sonnet-4.5 "Your prompt"

# List installed modules
amplifier module list

# Get info about a specific module
amplifier module info loop-basic
```

## Interactive Chat Mode

When you run `amplifier run --mode chat`, you enter an interactive session with powerful slash commands:

```bash
# Planning and execution
/think          # Enter plan mode (read-only, thoughtful responses)
/do             # Exit plan mode and allow modifications

# Session management
/save [file]    # Save conversation transcript
/clear          # Clear conversation history
/status         # Show current session status

# Discovery
/tools          # List available tools
/config         # Show current configuration
/help           # Show all commands

# Control
/stop           # Stop current execution
```

### Plan Mode

Use `/think` to enable plan mode where the AI can analyze and plan without making modifications. This is useful for:
- Reviewing complex changes before executing
- Getting thoughtful analysis of large codebases
- Planning multi-step refactoring

Use `/do` to exit plan mode and allow the AI to make modifications.

### Saving Transcripts

The `/save` command saves your conversation history to `.amplifier/transcripts/`:

```bash
# In chat mode
> /save my_session.json
âœ“ Transcript saved to .amplifier/transcripts/my_session.json
```

For detailed interactive mode documentation, see [docs/INTERACTIVE_MODE.md](docs/INTERACTIVE_MODE.md).

## Configuration

The CLI can be configured via:
- Command-line options (highest priority)
- Configuration file (`amplifier.toml` or custom path via `--config`)
- Environment variables

Example configuration:
```toml
[provider]
name = "anthropic"
model = "claude-sonnet-4.5"

[modules]
orchestrator = "loop-basic"
context = "context-simple"

[session]
max_tokens = 100000
auto_compact = true
```

## Module Management

The CLI provides commands to manage Amplifier modules:

- `amplifier module list` - List all installed modules
- `amplifier module info <name>` - Show detailed module information
- `amplifier module list --type agent` - List modules by type
