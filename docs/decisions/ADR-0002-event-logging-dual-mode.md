# ADR-0002: Per-Session Event Logging

**Status**: Implemented
**Date**: 2025-10-14
**Authors**: Brian Krabach, Claude Code
**Deciders**: Amplifier Core Team
**Relates to**: ADR-0001 (Project-Scoped Sessions)

---

## Context and Problem Statement

Session debugging and analysis require complete visibility into what happened during a session—not just the message transcript, but all events: tool calls, approvals, errors, timing, token usage, etc.

Previously, splitting events across multiple files (transcript in one location, events in another) made correlation difficult and prevented sessions from being truly self-contained.

---

## Decision

All events for a session are written to a per-session `events.jsonl` file within the session directory:

```
~/.amplifier/projects/<project-slug>/sessions/<session-id>/events.jsonl
```

This makes each session completely self-contained with all its data in one directory.

---

## Rationale

### Self-Contained Sessions

Having transcript + events + metadata in the same directory provides:

- **Complete traces**: Everything about a session in one place
- **Easy debugging**: No need to grep through global logs or correlate across files
- **Simple archival**: `tar -czf session.tar.gz ~/.amplifier/projects/.../sessions/abc-123/` = complete backup
- **Clean sharing**: Send session directory for bug reports with full context
- **Atomic cleanup**: Delete session directory = all data gone

### No Working Directory Clutter

Writing logs to `~/.amplifier/projects/` instead of `./amplifier.log.jsonl` in the working directory:

- **Cleaner projects**: No log files dropped in git repos or user projects
- **Centralized data**: All amplifier user data in `~/.amplifier/`
- **Clear separation**: Project code (working dir) vs user data (home dir)

### Session-Only Mode

The logging hook operates in `session-only` mode by default, writing events exclusively to per-session logs. This:

- **Simplifies**: One logging path, not dual-mode complexity
- **Aligns with UX**: Users debug specific sessions, not cross-session patterns
- **Reduces I/O**: Write once per event, not twice

---

## Implementation Details

### Logging Hook Configuration

```yaml
hooks:
  - module: hooks-logging
    config:
      mode: session-only
      session_log_template: ~/.amplifier/projects/{project}/sessions/{session_id}/events.jsonl
```

### Event Writing

The logging hook receives events from the kernel and writes them to the session-specific log:

```python
class LoggingHook:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.mode = config.get("mode", "session-only")
        self.session_log_template = config.get(
            "session_log_template",
            "~/.amplifier/projects/{project}/sessions/{session_id}/events.jsonl"
        )

    async def handle_event(self, event: str, data: dict):
        """Write event to session log."""
        session_id = data.get("session_id")
        if not session_id:
            return  # No session context, skip

        project_slug = get_project_slug()
        session_log_path = Path(
            self.session_log_template.format(
                project=project_slug,
                session_id=session_id
            )
        ).expanduser()

        session_log_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

        with open(session_log_path, "a") as f:
            json.dump({"ts": ..., "event": event, **data}, f, ensure_ascii=False)
            f.write("\n")
```

### Session Directory Structure

Complete self-contained session:

```
~/.amplifier/projects/-home-user-repos-myapp/sessions/abc-123/
├── transcript.jsonl       # Anthropic messages (for resumption)
├── events.jsonl          # All amplifier events (for debugging)
└── metadata.json         # Session info

# events.jsonl contains:
{"ts": "...", "event": "session:start", "session_id": "abc-123", ...}
{"ts": "...", "event": "prompt:submit", "data": {"prompt": "..."}, ...}
{"ts": "...", "event": "tool:pre", "data": {"tool": "bash", "args": {...}}, ...}
{"ts": "...", "event": "tool:post", "data": {"result": {...}}, ...}
{"ts": "...", "event": "approval:required", ...}
{"ts": "...", "event": "approval:granted", ...}
{"ts": "...", "event": "provider:response", "data": {"usage": {...}}, ...}
{"ts": "...", "event": "session:end", ...}
```

---

## Benefits for Debugging

**Unified debugging**:

```bash
$ cd ~/.amplifier/projects/-home-user-repos-myapp/sessions/abc-123/
$ cat events.jsonl | jq 'select(.event | contains("tool"))'
# All tool events right here - calls, results, errors, timing

$ cat transcript.jsonl | jq '.[] | select(.role == "user") | .content'
# User messages

$ cat metadata.json
# Session configuration, profile used, etc.
```

Everything in one directory, easy to inspect and correlate.

---

## Examples

### Use Case 1: Debug Why Tool Failed

```bash
$ cd ~/repos/myproject
$ amplifier sessions list
abc-123  "Build feature X"  5 messages  2025-10-14

$ cd ~/.amplifier/projects/-home-user-repos-myproject/sessions/abc-123/
$ cat events.jsonl | jq 'select(.event | startswith("tool:"))'
# Shows: tool:pre, approval:required, approval:granted, tool:post, tool:error
# Complete timeline of what happened
```

### Use Case 2: Archive Session for Bug Report

```bash
$ cd ~/.amplifier/projects/-home-user-repos-myapp/sessions/abc-123/
$ tar -czf ~/bug-report-session.tar.gz .
# Complete session trace for sharing
```

### Use Case 3: Project Cleanup

```bash
$ rm -rf ~/.amplifier/projects/-home-user-repos-old-project/
# Removes all sessions and logs for old-project
```

---

## Alternative Considered: Dual-Mode Logging

We considered writing events to BOTH per-session logs AND a global log file. This was rejected because:

- **Complexity**: More code, more configuration, more failure modes
- **Unnecessary**: Users debug specific sessions, not cross-session patterns
- **I/O overhead**: Writing every event twice
- **Working dir clutter**: Global log in project directory

If cross-session analysis is needed in the future, we can add project-level event aggregation as an optional feature.

---

## Configuration Options

### Default (Session-Only)

```yaml
hooks:
  - module: hooks-logging
    config:
      mode: session-only
      session_log_template: ~/.amplifier/projects/{project}/sessions/{session_id}/events.jsonl
```

### Future: Optional Project-Level Aggregation

```yaml
hooks:
  - module: hooks-logging
    config:
      mode: session-only
      session_log_template: ~/.amplifier/projects/{project}/sessions/{session_id}/events.jsonl
      # Optional: aggregate all project sessions
      project_log: ~/.amplifier/projects/{project}/events.jsonl
```

Not implemented initially—add only if users request it.

## Philosophy Alignment

**✅ Mechanism not Policy**: Logging hook is a module at the edge, not kernel code.

**✅ Ruthless Simplicity**: One logging path (session-only), no dual-mode complexity.

**✅ Text-First**: JSONL format, human-readable and tool-friendly.

**✅ Fail Gracefully**: Logging failures don't crash sessions (non-interference).

**✅ No Working Dir Clutter**: All user data centralized in `~/.amplifier/`.

---

## Success Metrics

- Sessions are completely self-contained ✅
- Debugging time reduced by single-location inspection ✅
- No log files dropped in project working directories ✅
- Event correlation is straightforward (same directory) ✅

---

## Related Decisions

- **ADR-0001**: Project-Scoped Sessions (provides the directory structure)
- **Kernel ADRs**: Unified JSONL schema, event taxonomy

## Review Triggers

This decision should be revisited if:
- Users request cross-session analysis features
- Performance issues with per-session event writing
- Alternative storage backends considered (database, streaming)

_This ADR documents per-session event logging that makes sessions self-contained and debugging straightforward._
