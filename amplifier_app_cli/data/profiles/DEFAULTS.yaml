# Amplifier System Defaults
# This is the SINGLE source of truth for system-level defaults

# Default profile when no profile is active
# This is the ONLY place to change the system default
default_profile: developer-expertise:dev

# Module registry URL
# URL to the central module registry index
# Users can override via ~/.amplifier/settings.yaml (registry.url)
# Projects can override via .amplifier/settings.yaml (registry.url)

# Rationale for "developer-expertise:dev" as default:
# - foundation:foundation: Too minimal (no tools, no hooks) - not practical
# - foundation:base: Good foundation but dev adds developer experience
# - developer-expertise:dev: Best starting point (streaming, web/search tools, agents)
# - foundation:production: Too restrictive for general use (persistent context not always wanted)
# - developer-expertise:full: Too heavy (loads everything, slower startup, overwhelming)
#
# When to change:
# - If we create a better general-purpose profile
# - After user research shows different preferences
# - If "base" becomes feature-complete enough for most users
#
# Note: Projects can override via .amplifier/settings.yaml (profile.default)
#       Users can override via ~/.amplifier/settings.yaml (profile.active)
#       Local dev can override via .amplifier/settings.local.yaml (profile.active)
