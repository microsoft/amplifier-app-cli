Collection resolver - Resolve collection names to paths.

CRITICAL (KERNEL_PHILOSOPHY): This is APP LAYER POLICY, not kernel mechanism.

Per KERNEL_PHILOSOPHY:
- "Could two teams want different behavior?" â†’ YES (search order is policy)
- Different apps could resolve collections differently
- Kernel doesn't know about collections

Per AGENTS.md: Ruthless simplicity - direct filesystem checks, no caching complexity.

    Resolve collection names to installation paths (APP LAYER POLICY).

    This class implements POLICY for how collection names map to filesystem paths.
    The kernel doesn't know about this - it's an app-layer decision.

    Different applications could:
    - Use different search orders
    - Add custom search locations
    - Implement different precedence rules

    Philosophy:
    - Simple, direct filesystem checks
    - No caching (YAGNI - optimize if needed later)
    - Clear error messages
