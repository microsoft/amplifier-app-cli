# Test: Verify that a recipe can execute a simple prompt and validate the result
# Expected outcome: Agent responds to prompt, validator confirms response quality
#
# This is the most basic recipe test - it verifies:
# 1. Recipe can execute steps sequentially
# 2. Context flows between steps (output -> next prompt)
# 3. Base agent (no explicit agent specified) works correctly
# 4. Validation can assess response quality

steps:
  - id: "execute-prompt"
    agent: "foundation:explorer"
    prompt: "Respond with a brief greeting (1-2 sentences) explaining what you are."
    output: "greeting_response"
    timeout: 30

  - id: "validate"
    agent: "recipes:result-validator"
    prompt: |
      You are a result validator. Review this response and determine if it's valid:
      
      Response: {{greeting_response}}
      
      Criteria:
      - Is it 1-2 sentences?
      - Does it explain what the agent is?
      - Is it coherent and complete?
      
      Provide your verdict in this exact format at the end:
      ✅ VERDICT: PASS
      or
      ❌ VERDICT: FAIL
      
      Explain your reasoning briefly before the verdict.
    timeout: 30
