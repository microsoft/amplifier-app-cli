tags: ["phase1", "feature-test", "tools", "grep", "search", "cli"]

context:
  fixtures_dir: "tests/recipes/fixtures"
  search_pattern: "def test_function"
  expected_file: "sample-code.py"

steps:
  - id: "test-grep"
    agent: "foundation:explorer"
    prompt: |
      Search for the pattern "{{search_pattern}}" in the directory {{fixtures_dir}}.
      
      Use the grep tool to find this pattern. Report back:
      1. Whether the search was successful
      2. Which file(s) contain the pattern
      3. The matching lines found
      
      Be specific about the grep operation and results.
    output: "grep_result"
    timeout: 30

  - id: "validate"
    agent: "recipes:result-validator"
    prompt: |
      Validate the grep tool execution from the previous step.
      
      RESULT TO VALIDATE:
      {{grep_result}}
      
      VALIDATION CRITERIA:
      1. The grep tool was successfully invoked
      2. The search pattern "{{search_pattern}}" was found
      3. The results include the file path (should contain "{{expected_file}}")
      4. The matching content includes the actual pattern text
      
      Provide a clear PASS or FAIL verdict.
      
      PASS if: All criteria met - grep tool worked and found the pattern
      FAIL if: Grep tool failed, pattern not found, or incomplete results
      
      Format your response with:
      - Evidence for each criterion
      - Final verdict: PASS or FAIL
    timeout: 30

# Test Execution:
#   amplifier recipes execute amplifier-app-cli/tests/recipes/features/tool-search.yaml
#
# What This Tests:
#   - CLI loads grep/search tool module correctly
#   - Search tool is accessible to agents (foundation:explorer)
#   - Pattern search operations work correctly
#   - Results are returned with file paths and match content
#
# Expected Outcome:
#   - Step 1: foundation:explorer uses grep to find "def test_function" in fixtures
#   - Step 2: result-validator confirms PASS verdict
#   - Overall: Validates grep tool integration in CLI
